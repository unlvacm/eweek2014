An Ant, going to a river to drink, fell in, and was 
carried along in the stream. A Dove pitied her condition, 
and threw into the river a small bough, by means of which 
the Ant gained the shore. The Ant afterward, seeing a man 
with a fowling-piece aiming at the Dove, stung him in the 
foot sharply, and made him miss his aim, and so saved the
Dove's life.
