# Problem 1: Rapid Editing

You just landed your first internship but unfortunately got stuck with a job as a secretary. For your first assignment, your boss has given you 500 electronic text documents, each with one line of text. The problem, as explained by your boss, is that the characters in each document are in reverse order. A document might have the text, "!snilbog etah I". Your job is to edit all of the documents to put the words in the correct order so that it reads "I hate goblins!" for example.

Being a programmer, you decide it would be more fun to write a program to convert the text rather than editing each document individually like your boss asked.

### Input 
Input will consist of one line of text.

### Output
Output will consist of one line of text corresponding to the reversed order of words for the input line.

### Assumptions
No error checking required. All input will be valid.

Program will be tested using Linux redirection. (e.g., $ ./a.out < sample-input.txt )

### Sample Input
```
!snilbog etah I
```
### Sample Output

```
I hate goblins!
```
